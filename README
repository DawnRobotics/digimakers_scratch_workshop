This is code and documentation for a workshop that we ran teaching beginners how to program a Raspberry Pi Robot using the Scratch programming language.

A series of blog posts describing the hardware and software that we used for the robot can be found at http://blog.dawnrobotics.co.uk/2013/11/building-a-raspberry-pi-robot-and-controlling-it-with-scratch-part-1.
